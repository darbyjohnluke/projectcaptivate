# projectcaptivate
Hello all, This is a project meant to experiment on the job search division of searchlife mission. The objective of this project is to create a tool or an engine to search and recommend jobs relevant to an individual based on the information read from one's resume and provide recommendations. The recommendations include jobs, skills and learnable skills for certain job recommendations for which the individual doesn't have necessary skills. This tool will recommend based on location, profile, skill, age barrier and educational background if applicable.
This tool is in beta stage and might not recognise all formats of resume and might provide wrong recommendations and learnable skills and is not intended for serious use or emergencies.
